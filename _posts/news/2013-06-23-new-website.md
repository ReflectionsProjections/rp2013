Welcome to our shiny new website! Hopefully it will be a bit more informative than the landing page we have had up for the past few months. We apologize for the delay in getting this site online.

<br />

Keep checking back here for new speaker announcements, a list of companies attending the career fair, and a more detailed schedule.  Closer to the confernece, you will be able to access biographies of speakers and their talk abstracts.  

<br />

Please feel free to [email us](mailto:conference@acm.uiuc.edu) if you see any bugs, can't find some information that you think should be here, or have any other concerns.  

<br />

Sincerely,  
The Reflections | Projections 2013 Staff
