session: "That Shouldn't Work; Manufacturing Computer Chips"

For over a decade, the end of the ability of semiconductors scaling has been predicted. Modern computer chips are using transistors with features as small as 11nm.  Combined, these devices run everything from your car to the Internet. They are produced in factories that are 10,000 times cleaner than an operating room at rates exceeding 10billion transistors per second.  This talk will go over how and why the design of a modern nanoscale transistor has developed.   It includes the basics of the processes used to build chips, the incredible equipment that makes it all possible, and where the scaling (might) end. Plus some fun stories about what goes wrong inside a FAB.


## About Todd
Todd is a mechanical engineer with a background in thin film characterization and semiconductor manufacturing.  A former engineer on Intel's 32nm process, he know consults for a number of high tech startup's on product definition and transitioning from development to manufacturing.  If he's not on an airplane he can usually be found trying to reverse engineer his Subaru.
