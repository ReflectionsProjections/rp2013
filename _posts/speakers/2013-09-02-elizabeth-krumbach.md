How can you build a career working on Free and Open Source Software
(F/OSS)? Elizabeth will talk about her own career in F/OSS, including
social and volunteer involvement in projects and user groups, early
jobs she had that focused on using F/OSS and her current role at HP
working on the OpenStack Infrastructure team where she works closely
and openly with individuals from several other companies on a F/OSS
product.

## About Elizabeth
In her role in HP, Elizabeth works directly on the
OpenStack open source project on the core infrastructure team. This
team runs the project Linux-based servers and services (wiki,
etherpad, etc.) as well as the fully open source continuous
integration and code review systems for developers.
