An overview of how to build a web site that actually scales with both engineers and customers. Tulloss will go over the actual high level architectural decisions that should be made from the databases all the way to the user's interactions, plus diving into what the state of the art technologies are for doing this right now. He hopes for this to be filled with practical advice gained over 3.5 years at Rdio and 5 years talking to people in the bay area about how the most popular web sites on the internet are built.

## About Justin
Justin is mainly a UIUC alum, but to fill the time he is an engineer turned manager on the web team at Rdio. Over the past 3 years, he's helped write the software that today serves millions of users and is maintained by over 50 engineers. He currently lives in San Francisco and thinks that place is pretty cool.
