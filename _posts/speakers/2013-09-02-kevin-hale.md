In twenty-five years, the Mongol army subjugated more lands and
people than the Romans had conquered in four hundred years. Whether
measured by the total number of people defeated, the sum of the
countries annexed, or by the total area occupied, Genghis Khan
conquered more than twice as much as any other man in history and he
did it all with an army that was nearly always outnumbered 3 to 1 on
the battlefield. While every technique doesn't always translate well,
Iâ€™ll talk about a few that works great in any startup.
