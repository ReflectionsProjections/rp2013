session: "Everything I needed to know to succeed I learned in ACM@UIUC"

While classes can prepare you with some of the skills you need to succeed they don't cover many important lessons that can only be gained by hands-on experience. Luckily at UIUC the ACM student chapter makes up for this deficiency offering experiences in creation and development that are fundamentally no different from those found outside the academic world. With so many opportunities to work on projects outside of class it should be no surprise that some of the most successful people are B and C students who prioritized doing projects over better grades.

In this talk Josh will reflect on 15 years of working at big companies, small companies, academic institutions, startups, and founding his own companies and compare them to experiences he had right here in ACM@UIUC. This comedic exploration will show how experiences like Engineering Open House, Conference, and Mechmania among others are crucial to success post-graduation. If you're already in to doing side projects come to learn how to make the most of your time working on them. If you haven't gotten into projects outside your classes yet come to learn what you've been missing and how to get started.
