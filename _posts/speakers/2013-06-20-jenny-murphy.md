# Exploring the Glass Platform
By bringing technology closer, we can get it out of the way.  This
innovative idea will be taken as a foundation for exploring Glass and
the Glass platform.  We'll cover the latest design principles for
Glass software (called Glassware), continue with an overview of the
Glass platform, and take an in-depth look at the Google Mirror API.
Examples of current and future Glassware will be shown to demonstrate
best practices and give a glimpse at the future of personal computing
we are creating together.  Plenty of time will be left for questions
and conversation.
