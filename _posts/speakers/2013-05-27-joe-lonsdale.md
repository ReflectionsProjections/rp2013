# Man-Machine Symbiosis and the Smart Enterprise Wave
Over the last hundred years, five major trends have dominated Silicon
Valley (SV): “Electronic Tools,” “Semiconductor,” “Enterprise,”
“Telecom,” and “Consumer.” A sixth trend has emerged. We call it
“Smart Enterprise.” The Smart Enterprise wave will disrupt nearly
every major sector of the global economy and dramatically improve
productivity within those sectors, because it disrupts non-linear
decision-making processes that are central to how major industries
conduct business and create value. These decision-making processes
have been complicated over the last two decades by the vast growth of
digital information. In the past five years alone, the amount of data
in existence has grown nine-fold, to over 2 trillion gigabytes. This
increase has brought a corresponding increase in data complexity,
formats, and silos that require sophisticated technology platforms to
help knowledge workers process and leverage the information
effectively. Another tenet of the Smart Enterprise thesis is that
technology is best utilized as a augmenter to human capital, not as a
replacement. Humans and machines have fundamentally different
strengths (machines with computation and linear processes, humans with
strategic and abstract thinking), and it is naïve to believe that
technology can replace humans anytime soon. Instead, Smart Enterprise
companies produce technology which humans can leverage to solve big,
unstructured problems which have outsized impact on our economy and
society.
