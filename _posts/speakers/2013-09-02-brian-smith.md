# Make Something People Love

One of the main reasons I joined Dropbox was the opportunity to see how the metaphorical sausage is made: how a small group of engineers and designers can build a high quality product that is used and loved by millions of people. When I showed up on my first day, they seemed to be doing everything wrong: they wrote fragile code just to show a green checkmark, didn't have a QA department, and spent a lot of time answering support emails and forum posts. Only after I had been there for a few months did I understand the rationale behind these choices. In my talk, I'll try to capture the obsessive focus on quality that motivated these practices and elevated Dropbox from being a me-too in a crowded market into something people loved.


## Biography

Brian has had a fascination with consumer software since building a
social mustic player for Engineering Open House as part of SIGSoft. He
graduated from UIUC in 2008 and spent a couple years figuring out what
he didn't want to do before joining Dropbox in 2010. Since then, he's
worked on a variety of projects at Dropbox, most recently launching
the Datastores API at DBX in July.
