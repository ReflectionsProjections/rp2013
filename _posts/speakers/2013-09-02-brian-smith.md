<p>One of the main reasons Smith joined Dropbox was to see how the metaphorical sausage is made: how a small group of engineers and designers can build a high quality product that is used and loved by millions of people. When he showed up on his first day, they seemed to be doing everything wrong: they wrote fragile code just to show a green check mark, didn't have a QA department, and spent a lot of time answering support emails and forum posts. Only after Smith had been there for a few months did he understand the rationale behind these choices. In his talk, Smith will try to capture the obsessive focus on quality that motivated these practices and elevated Dropbox from being a me-too in a crowded market into something people loved.</p>
