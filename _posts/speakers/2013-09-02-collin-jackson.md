The vast majority of mobile devices today are running either Apple’s
iOS or Google’s Android operating system. Top developers cannot afford
to ignore either platform. Increasing, they are choosing Objective-C
as their cross-platform language of choice. In the short time span of
this talk, we’ll show how to create a physics-based “Angry Birds”
style game from scratch using only free, open source Objective-C
tools. And if you thought Objective-C was only for Apple devices,
you’re wrong -- using Apportable, the game will run equally well on
both iOS and Android. We'll talk about what this means for mobile developers and what you can expect in the future.
