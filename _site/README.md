======

The website for the 2013 Reflections | Projections Conference.

This site is written using the [Jekyll static site generator](http://jekyllrb.com).

Gems
====
In addition to the normal gems that Jekyll requires, we will be using the [liquid-inheritance gem](https://github.com/danwrong/liquid-inheritance) which adds the *extends* and *block* tag for those familiar with Django.
