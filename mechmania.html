	  MechMania is a 24-hour programming contest in which teams of students from various schools compete to create an AI capable of playing (and winning) a strategy game that we have developed for the event.

    <p>
      We accept teams of up to three people in two brackets: the student competition and the corporate competition.</p>

    <h4>Student Competition</h4>
    <p>Our student competition accepts up to 30 teams and pits them against each other in one final battle. Teams do not need to be comprised of all students from the same school, but all participants must be actively enrolled in a college or university.</p>

    <h4>Corporate Competition</h4>
    <p>The corporate competition is open to teams representing companies. Be sure to contact us if your company is interested in participating in this year's competition. There are no prizes (other than the joy of winning) for corporate competitors.</p>

  <h2 class="title">What you need to know<span class="line"></span></h2>
</div>
<div class="sixteen columns">
  <p>All members should be proficient in the programming language their team intends to use. The API will use JSON messages passed over a socket connection, so we recommend having knowledge of JSON and networking libraries in your chosen language.</p>
</div>
<div class="sixteen columns">
  <h2 class="title">What you don't need to know<span class="line"></span></h2>
</div>
<div class="sixteen columns">
  <p>No prior knowledge of any specific languages are required<sup>1</sup>. You won't need a background in artificial intelligenceâ€”in previous years, many teams without an AI background have competed and done well, or even won. You also shouldn't need knowledge of network programming beyond HTTP requests.</p>

<div class="sixteen columns">
  <h2 class="title">What you can bring<span class="line"></span></h2>
</div>
<div class="sixteen columns">
  <p>You can bring any reference manual(s) you wish, whether it be the <i>Art of Computer Programming</i> or the <i>Art of War</i>. But absolutely no outside code. You may, however, bring non-code items like rc files, build scripts, notes, etc. Competitors are allowed to bring their own laptops, though the code you write must be capable of running on our systems.</p>

  <h2 class="title">What you'll do<span class="line"></span></h2>
</div>
<div class="sixteen columns">
  <p>By either starting from scratch or using our provided sample clients, you will build an artificial intelligence client to play a strategy game of our design. Our API will provide you information about the current state of the game, as well as allow you to send commands to play it. You may find previous competition sites useful to get an idea of how MechMania operates.</p>

<div class="sixteen columns">
  <p>The competition will begin with the opening ceremony and announcement of the game on Friday, October 11, after which the programming component will commence immediately. The competition will end Saturday evening after running for 24 hours. We will present the closing ceremony and awards Sunday afternoon.</p>

  <p>1 You may only use languages and language features that compile and run on our test machine. Note that this means you should avoid Linux-specific C/C++. Pure Unix-targeted code should suffice.</p>
